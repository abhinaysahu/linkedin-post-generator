The effort you put in will pay off eventually!\n\n#techcareer #dreamjob #careerswitch #upskilling #google #microsoft",

    "text": "I had just 2 days to prepare for my Microsoft interview!\n\nOn Thursday, I got a call from the recruiter — ‘Interview this Saturday?’\n\nI almost said no but it was the BIGGEST opportunity of my life so I agreed.\n✅ I quickly went through my bookmarked DSA problems \n✅ I read past Microsoft interview experiences and found common questions.\n✅ For system design, I practiced common design patterns, SOLID principles, and HLD problems.\n✅ Then, I reached out to senior SDEs for mocks—practiced those questions under pressure, got feedback & ensured I make no mistakes in the real interview.\n\nThen, the interview day came → Two rounds (DSA + System Design) on the same day. \nThe questions were difficult, the pressure was high but my practice & those mocks paid off—I came out with an offer!🚀\n\nP.S. Let me be clear: this wasn’t ‘2 days of prep.’ It was consistent efforts since 2nd year of college, learning and practicing regularly. \n\nTo those preparing: Trust the process. The work you're putting in now will show up when it matters most!✨\n\n#dsa #interviewpreparation #tech",

DP? Backtracking?)\n✅ Practice 5–6 handpicked Leetcode problems per pattern\n✅ Cover 250–300 essential questions\n✅ Track progress and customize your prep\n\n📌 Get your copy here → https://bit.ly/3I1i7UT\n\nPrep smart & Solve faster :)\n\n#dsapatternsheet #interviewpreparation #dsa",

What does it actually take to switch from a service-based company to a top product-based one?\n5. Is it really possible to go from a Tier-3 college to working at amazing product companies? How?\n\n6. How do I avoid wasting years making random mistakes in my prep?\n7. Can mentorship speed up my journey if I want results this year, not someday?\n\nMy take on these questions? \nLearning directly from people who’ve actually done it will save you months of trial and error.

Not just because I didn’t crack them, but because I KNEW I could have done better.\n\nAfter every rejection, I’d replay the questions in my head.\n→ “Explain closures.”\n→ “Optimize a list rendering in React.”\n→ “What’s the difference between useMemo and useCallback?”\n\nI knew the answers. But in interviews? I froze. It wasn’t that I didn’t know React.\n\n📌It’s that I never prepared for interview-level React.\n\nAnd once I realized that, everything changed. Here’s what I did 👇\n\n✅ I stopped revising concepts in isolation. \n✅ I started solving interview questions, building real components, and revising JS from the system design lens.\n\nIt’s not just about building with React. It’s about thinking in patterns and explaining with clarity. \n\nThat’s where most SDE-1/2 fall short, even with years of work behind them.\n\nIf you're also facing repeated rejections, please know this → You're not underqualified.
